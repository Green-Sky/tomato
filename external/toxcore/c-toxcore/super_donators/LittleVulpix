Thank you to all the tox-devs for the idea of a privacy-oriented chat protocol.
Thank you for seeing it through so that we have tox in its current state. It has ways to go, but it's already pretty good!
It is my dream that it will one day be as popular (or even more so) than the other protocols.
Thank you to everyone who is actively participating in maintaining and fixing things to make tox better today than it was yesterday!
And finally a big thanks to the community that stayed together even through semi-tough times and united to fund the campaign!

Working filetransfers are my 'gift' to you all! Thanks to irungentoo for making it happen.
