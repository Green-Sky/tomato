# There are ways to make 'static_assert()' work, but they are rather annoying --

# - Turning 'a' and 'b' into enum constants would make it work, but this falls
#   apart if the enum types are compared against non-enums down the line
#     error: enumerated and non-enumerated type in conditional expression [-Werror=extra]
#
# - Turning 'a' and 'b' into pre-processor macros is the only option left, but
#   #defines and #undefs in the middle of a function hurt the readability and
#   are less idiomatic than simply using 'const int'.
