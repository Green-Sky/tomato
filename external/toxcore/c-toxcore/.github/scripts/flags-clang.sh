# Very verbose, not very useful. This warns about things like int -> uint
# conversions that change sign without a cast and narrowing conversions.

# correctness and remove this suppression.
add_flag -Wno-covered-switch-default
# We use C99, so declarations can come after statements.

# Due to clang's tolower() macro being recursive

# Bootstrap daemon does this.
add_flag -Wno-format-nonliteral
# struct Foo foo = {0}; is a common idiom. Missing braces means we'd need to
# write {{{0}}} in some cases, which is ugly and a maintenance burden.
add_flag -Wno-missing-braces
add_flag -Wno-missing-field-initializers
# We don't use this attribute. It appears in the non-NDEBUG stderr logger.
add_flag -Wno-missing-noreturn
# Useful sometimes, but we accept padding in structs for clarity.
# Reordering fields to avoid padding will reduce readability.
add_flag -Wno-padded
# This warns on things like _XOPEN_SOURCE, which we currently need (we
# probably won't need these in the future).
add_flag -Wno-reserved-id-macro
# TODO(iphydf): Clean these up. They are likely not bugs, but still
# potential issues and probably confusing.
add_flag -Wno-sign-compare
# __attribute__((nonnull)) causes this warning on defensive null checks.

# Our use of mutexes results in a false positive, see 1bbe446.
